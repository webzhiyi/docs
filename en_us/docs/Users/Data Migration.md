# Data Migration
Currently VNote does not provide much support about migrating data from other applications due to development resource limits. Here are a list of third-party tools that help migration from common applications.

Feel free to contact us to add more here if you built a util tool for this.

## [ImageBedMoving](https://github.com/StarLeet/ImageBedMoving)
This tool helps moving images from other folders to VNote's `vx_images` folder. Usually you could use this tool after building notebook from external folder in VNote to do a clean up of the images.
